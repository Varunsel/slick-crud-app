# slick-crud-app
This is a simple Python CRUD application that uses data (https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/addresses.csv) from the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University along with Flask and SQLite3 to teach simple mySQL queries.

### Application Notes:
This CRUD application provides mySQL query code for simple database operations performed by the user via a GUI.  These simple database operations are ideal for beginners to create and maintain small databases.  The user can insert data into a table, delete data from a table, edit data in a table, and list data in a table.  When the user performs these operations in the GUI, the corresponding query code is displayed.
